/*Generics*/

//Generic code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions and types thath can work with any type, subject to requirements that define. You can write code that voids duplication and expresses its intent in a clear, abstracted manner.


/*The Problem That Generics Solve*/

//Here's standard, nongeneric function called swapTwoInts(_:_:), which swaps two Int values:

func swapTwoInts(_ a: inout Int,_ b: inout Int) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}

//The swapTwoInts(_:_:) function swaps the original value of b into a, and the original value of a into b. You can call this function to swap the values in two Int variables:

var someInt = 3

var anotherInt = 107
swapTwoInts(&someInt, &anotherInt)

print("someInt is now \(someInt), and anotherInt is now \(anotherInt)")

//

func swapTwoStrings(_ a: inout String, _ b: inout String) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}

func swapTwoDoubles(_ a: inout Double, _ b: inout Double) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}

//You may have noticed that the bodies of the swapTwoInts(_:_:), swapTwoStrings(_:_:), and swapTwoDoubles(_:_:) functions are identical. The only difference is the type of the values that they accept(Int, String, and Double).

//It's more useful, and considerably more flexible, to write a single function that swaps two values of any type. Generic code enables you to write such a function.

//NOTE

//In all three functions, the types of a and b must be the same. If a and b aren't of the same type, it isn't possible to swap their values.  Swift is a type-safe language, and doesn’t allow (for example) a variable of type String and a variable of type Double to swap values with each other. Attempting to do so results in a compile-time error.s

//Generic Functions

//Generic functions can work with any type. Here’s a generic version of the swapTwoInts(_:_:) function from above, called swapTwoValues(_:_:):

func swapTwoValues<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}


//The body of the swapTwoValues(_:_:) function is identical to the body of the swapTwoInts(_:_:) function. However, the first line of swapTwoValues(_:_:) is slightly different from swapTwoInts(_:_:). Here’s how the first lines compare:
//
//func swapTwoInts(_ a: inout Int, _ b: inout Int)
//func swapTwoValues<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T)
